# Final Project: To-Do App
## App Features and functionalities
- Add a task (with validation) and store the tasks.
- Have a realtime track of no of active tasks.
- Delete a task and keep the history of all the deleted tasks.
- Also,since data is stored in local storage using ASyncStorage, the tasks are not lost(which generally occurs if only redux is used) even after restarting or removing the app from RAM.
- Apart from the above, due to some errors(that i couldn't debug) the edit functionality was not implemented successfully although the commented code for the same is present in the java-script file. 
## Tech Stack and API used to build the app
- The App is build using React Native
- React Redux is used to manage the react components' states of the app
- React Navigation is used to facilitate navigation between screens and also implement BottomTabBar and SideDrawer.
- ASyncStorage is used to store the task data locally in the mobile storage in the form of user data.
- Adobe XD is used to design the UI for the app
- CSS is used for styling different UI components in React Native.
